Welcome to my personal tech portfolio and blog!

<blockquote class="my-3">
  <b>I'm a wizard who transforms your digital dreams into reality.</b>
</blockquote>

More formally, I'm <b>Mukesh Tandale \| d093w1z</b>, and I've been programming for the past 8 years, starting my journey at the age of 16 as a self-taught programmer. My fascination with computers led me to earn a <b>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.</b> 

Here, you'll find a collection of my [projects](/projects) and [blog](/blog) posts covering topics that excite me the most: Linux, C++, and web development using the MERN stack. 

When I'm not coding, I love tinkering with my Linux setup and diving into a good [book](/blog/tag/books). Join me as I explore the ever-evolving world of technology!
